    You can perform mathematical-like addition operations on numbers.
    Both string concatenation and addition use the plus + symbol. This is called overloading an operator, and the compiler infers the proper use based on the data types it's operating on.
    When it can, the C# compiler will implicitly convert an int into a string if it's obvious that the developer is trying to concatenate the string representation of a number for presentation purposes.
    Use parentheses to define an order of operations to explicitly tell the compiler that you want to perform certain operations before other operations.
